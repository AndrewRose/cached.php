PHP Memcache Server Implementation

Developed with PHP 5.4.3 and modules: pdo_mysql, posix, libevent

To install libevent:

 pacman -S php-pear
 pecl install libevent channel://pecl.php.net/libevent-0.0.5
 echo "extension=libevent.so" >> /etc/php/conf.d/libevent.ini

To start: ./cached.php
To stop: killall cached.php

An initial test was conducted inserting 100k key/value pairs.  This implementation of a memcache server that is database backed used ~5x more memory and was 3.5x slower than the official memcache server.
